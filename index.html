<!--The "id" below refers to an "id tag" that styles this image in a specific way -
you will find the styling in the .css file.-->

  <div id="bio">
    <h1><u>Crea Wilhelmi</u></h1>
  </div>
  
<!--the "a href" tag creates a link. In this case, I gave each project its own link so
that it will take you to that particular project on this page. See below where the "id"
of each project div is labeled "project1" or "project2" (etc.)-->

      <h2>IDEAS 120 CLASS PROJECTS</h2>
      <li>PROJECT 1: <a href="#project1">Github Poetry</a></li>

<!--the "class" tag works a lot like the "id" tag, except it's helpful to use for a whole class
of divs - in this case, the "img_left" class will style all the images I want to align to the left
of the page.-->
  <div class="img_left" id="project1"><img src="image/FlarfPoem.jpg"></div>
  <div class="text_right">
    <p><h3>PROJECT #1</h3></br>For this first project we were tasked with writing a "flarf" poem around a Google search of a text we had sent recently. The text I sent was "pano picture of the basement or murphy will fart" in reference to my aunt renovating her basement and me asking for a picture or else murphy (her dog) would fart. It was very silly and prompted a Google search about dogs being scared of basements. I took that and ran with it, creating a spooky basement poem.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="img_right" id="project2"><img src="image/Proje2GreenScreen.jpg"></div>
  <div class="text_left">
    <p><h3>PROJECT #2</h3></br>Project 2 asked us to explore the idea of Green Screen. We were tasked with takig a video that looped and recording ourselves over it using Zoom or another meeting plattform. I love the rain adn thought it would be cool to film that and then sit on Zoom while doing homework as if I were sitting outside.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="img_left" id="project3"><img src="image/Jungle.jpg"></div>
  <div class="text_right">
    <p><h3>PROJECT #3</h3></br>Project 3 tasked us with creating a non linear narrative style game. My game requires a brave adventurer who is willing to treck through the unknown to find a lost artifact.</p>

  <div class="img_right" id="project4"><img src="image/StevieWonderPoster.jpg"></div>
  <div class="text_left">
    <p><h3>PERSONAL WORK</h3></br>A lot of the work I have done over the years centers around the difficulty of finding music posters that matched my aesthetic. At the last college I attened one of the projects for one of my classes entailed us making promotional material for an upcoming show of an artist we enjoyed. After completing that assignment I though to myself, why don't I start designing my own posters for myself and friends and that is where this poster comes into play. I made it for my ex-boyfriend before I moved back to Chicago from New Orleans. "Isn't She Lovely" by Stevie Wonder is his favorite song. He wanted to hang the poster up in his room, which featured a lot of navy and yellow, hence the use of both in this poster. Tuesday, November 1st was our first date and Urban Roots was the location. The stars were my "artist mark" one could say as I am obsessed with the shape.
